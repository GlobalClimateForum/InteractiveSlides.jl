# InteractivePresentations

Swiftly create interactive presentations in Julia which run in the browser as single-page applications. InteractivePresentations.jl leverages the [Genie framework](https://www.genieframework.com/) and therefore allows for presentations to contain reactive UI elements, including beautiful input forms, tables, and plots. InteractivePresentations.jl simplifies tasks such as creating a menu, a header, a footer, and of course the slides themselves. The package also allows to serve presentations on multiple screens, where each screen accepts different inputs, which is useful when there are several teams. The inputs (and potential outputs based on those inputs) of each team can easily be visualized and compared.
